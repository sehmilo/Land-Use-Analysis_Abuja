 # Overview
In this project, the data obtained displays a map of land use/land cover (LULC) derived from [ESA Sentinel-2 imagery](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/landcoverexplorer/#mapCenter=-83.21%2C34.332%2C4&mode=step&timeExtent=2017%2C2021&year=2017&downloadMode=true) at 10m resolution. Each year is generated with Impact Observatory’s deep learning AI land classification model, trained using billions of human-labeled image pixels from the National Geographic Society. The maps are produced by applying this model to the Sentinel-2 Level-2A image collection on Microsoft’s Planetary Computer, processing over 400,000 Earth observations per year.
